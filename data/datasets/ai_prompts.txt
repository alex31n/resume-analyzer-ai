I need to build a demo AI project for the Resume Analyzer. 
In this AI model, it can analyze given Resume document files and give a summary and score with matched skills, education, keywords. Also, it suggests the best roles that suit the candidate.

My plan is to fine-tune Llama 3.1 8b with a resume dataset. I couldn't find any proper dataset for this case. so I need to create a demo dataset.

Generate a realistic resume dataset with the following fields:
job_category - Broad industry category.
job_role - Specific job title.
skills - A comma-separated list of key skills relevant to the job role.
experience - Number of years of experience.
education - Educational background.
resume_text - A detailed, unstructured, realistic, and diverse resume summary.
Guidelines for resume_text generation:
The length should be much longer, between 100 and 300 words.
Include a random real name for demo.
The format should vary across resumes to reflect real-world diversity in resume writing styles.
Use different sections and different labels that look like a real resume.
Use a mix of structured and freeform formats, including bullet points, paragraphs, and headings.
Use different different formats and styles
Ensure randomized sentence structures and layouts to improve AI training.
Add random additional details, such as:
Contributions to open-source projects.
Leadership experience in technical teams.
Achievements like awards or publications.
Mentorship experience or training roles.
Ensure the generated resumes are rich in text, realistic, and balanced, as if parsed from actual resumes. these demo data look like real.

write only json file with 100+ records
